# Group-finder

The aim of this project is to promote the study groups, knowing their benefits and what this kind of learning method provides to the students.

This project proposes the development of a prototype of a mobile application with which users will be able to manage theirs own study groups and to participate in a university program in which a more expecienced student could help newcomer students in academic issues or managing their university procedures.

Every group has his own wall where the group members will be able to send messages to each other, and features a private file repository.
